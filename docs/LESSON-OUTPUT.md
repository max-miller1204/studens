# Dedicated lesson response

This is the response format for dedicated Pi, Claude Code, and Codex teachers.
The private key and plan examples elsewhere describe files that the service writes;
do not copy those file shapes into this response. This complete example shows the
three separate obligations: the original prequestion rubric, the original check
rubric, and the private variants of that check. The variants never stand in for
an original question. Choose content and controls for the requested objective;
the example topic, names, question counts, and layout are not requirements.

Build the original `quizzes` inventory before the private `variants` pool. For each
`form.cl-quiz` in `lesson_html`, including forms inside a template, provide one
quiz row. For each original `li.cl-q`, provide its own question row, rubric, and
mapping. Then add two or three variants per check question. Cross-check exact ids
against the original inventory. Keep private expected answers, criteria, mappings,
and variant HTML out of `lesson_html`.

The response control and the cognitive task are separate contracts. HTML
`data-type` chooses a control: `choice`, `multi`, `term`, `short`, `numeric`,
`cloze`, `order`, `match`, `locate`, or `code`. The private `task` chooses what
thinking the question requires. For a written prediction, use `data-type="short"`
with a textarea and `task: "prediction"` in the private question row. Never put
`prediction`, `explanation`, `application`, or another mental-task label in
`data-type`. Check this separately for every original and variant fragment.

Gates require balanced HTML. Close all containers opened inside a template before
`</template>`; close containers outside it outside it. Indent the teaching and
check as siblings where appropriate. Do not rely on the browser to repair tags.
The host validates both hidden source and released content, then checks the page.
