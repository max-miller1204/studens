## Install

**Pi**

```sh
pi install git:github.com/max-miller1204/studens@v0.11.7
```

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add max-miller1204/studens
claude plugin install studens@studens
```

**Codex**

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add max-miller1204/studens
codex plugin add studens@studens
```

All hosts require Node 22.19 or later, including the packaged Pi SDK. The plugin installs its runtime
dependencies on first start. There is no build step.

Pi installs the named release tag. Both plugin marketplaces also fetch the plugin
from a release tag, even when the catalog tracks `main`. Merging a feature PR does
not change the installed release. See [updating Studens](docs/USAGE.md#updating-studens)
for upgrades and moving an existing checkout installation to releases.

Upgrading from pi-teach? Remove the old plugin before installing Studens; see the
[upgrade guide](docs/USAGE.md#upgrading-from-pi-teach). Existing classrooms stay in place.

## Start learning

- **Pi:** `/teach <topic>`, then `/classroom` for the lesson link. The teacher service stays running after Pi exits.
- **Claude Code:** `/studens:teach <topic>` and `/studens:classroom`.
- **Codex:** Ask it to teach you a topic, then open your classroom.

Read, ask questions, and reply to the teacher on the lesson page. Quizzes save your
answers and feedback. The classroom page offers spaced reviews and folders.
Claude Code and Codex teachers run in a persistent local service.

All three hosts save material in `~/.pi/agent/classrooms/`.
